# Release 1.0.0

The TypeScript SDK now reaches parity with the .NET Semantic Kernel. Core, OpenAI and HF connectors, tracing and web/graph plugins are available. Quick start instructions are provided in `README.md`. The stepwise planner is included but remains experimental.

Running `pnpm test` enforces >85% coverage and the `benchmark` script confirms <10ms overhead per native call.
