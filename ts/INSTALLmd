# Installation Guide

This workspace requires **Node.js 18+** and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

1. Install dependencies for all packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build the packages:

```bash
pnpm -r run build
```

After the build completes, the compiled ESM output can be used directly or executed with `pnpm benchmark` or any of the provided samples.
